# Take home assignment

## Goal
Create a react app and build a few screens as specified in a figma file which will be shared separately via email.

## Users
This app will be used by dermatologists when they review a patient's case.

## Requirements
- This app should make use of [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) for design and components.
- Your code should be written in Javascript.
- Use Redux for state management.

## Submission
- Fork this github repository and check in your code.
- Create a new branch with your name and start working on the assignment.
- Once you are done, push your changes to your forked repository and share the link with us.
- Please include a screen recording of navigating between screens in your README file.

## Getting Started
 - Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
 - Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
 - Run `npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001` to start the json (db) server in separate terminal.
 - Run `npm start` to start the app.
   - Runs the app in the development mode. 
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. 
   - The page will reload when you make changes.
   - You may also see any lint errors in the console.
 - I have created a simple component and the first page in the `src/components` and `src/pages` respectively to save time on boilerplate code setup. You can use them as needed.
